                        i love bringing designs and ideas to life through technology. 
                        i'm into webtoons, lovebite (it's a snack), kpop, anime, and watching people make cool shit. 
                        my goal in life is to shut up and create something. i love designing and all forms of art like video 
                        editing, coding websites, and making an impact in the world. i'm drawn to ambitious people who want

                        after effects, photoshop, touchdesigner, three.js, blender. All these technologies excite me. i want
                         to collaborate with like-minded people, building for the better. my goal in life is to:
